<h1> Simple Array Database System</h1>
<h2> Using arrays to store 2d data and sql for querying  </h2>

<ul>

  <li> Arrays in JS  have dynamic means we can increase their size at runtime </li>
  <li> We can use this to add as much data as possible </li>
  <li>We can use SQL for querying </li>
  <li>instead using commands directly we turn commands into buttons because it will get complex if we compile and run commands by our own</li>
  <li> this can be used to practice concepts like Array basics, and array methods like foreach(), map(),filter(),reduce(),push() and more </li>
</ul>
